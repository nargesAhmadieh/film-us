Film-Us

In film-Us application, I display a list of popular movies in different genres.

In this program, I used the json server to create mock API ,for display the data, use npm run server command.

this program created by vite , for start application use npm run dev .

The End-to-End test was done using cypress. To view the result, use the npx cypress run command or run the npx cypress open command to view it in the cypress directory.
